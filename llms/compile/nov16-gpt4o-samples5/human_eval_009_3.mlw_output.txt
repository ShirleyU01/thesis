=======================TestCases=====================

    For the given implementation, some of testcases failed. Here are the list of failed testcases:
    for input Cons ((Cons (-5) (Cons 0 (Cons (-10) (Cons 5 (Nil))))); the output we obtained with current implementation is (Cons 0 (Cons 0 (Cons 5 (Nil)))); but the expected output is (Cons (-5) (Cons 0 (Cons 0 (Cons 5 (Nil))))))
for input Cons ((Cons 10 (Cons 5 (Cons 20 (Cons 15 (Nil))))); the output we obtained with current implementation is (Cons 10 (Cons 20 (Cons 20 (Nil)))); but the expected output is (Cons 10 (Cons 10 (Cons 20 (Cons 20 (Nil))))))
for input Cons ((Cons 1 (Cons 3 (Cons 2 (Cons 5 (Cons 4 (Cons 6 (Nil))))))); the output we obtained with current implementation is (Cons 3 (Cons 3 (Cons 5 (Cons 5 (Cons 6 (Nil)))))); but the expected output is (Cons 1 (Cons 3 (Cons 3 (Cons 5 (Cons 5 (Cons 6 (Nil))))))))
for input Cons ((Cons 1 (Cons 2 (Cons 3 (Cons 2 (Cons 3 (Cons 4 (Cons 2 (Nil)))))))); the output we obtained with current implementation is (Cons 2 (Cons 3 (Cons 3 (Cons 3 (Cons 4 (Cons 4 (Nil))))))); but the expected output is (Cons 1 (Cons 2 (Cons 3 (Cons 3 (Cons 3 (Cons 4 (Cons 4 (Nil)))))))))
 
    Please revise the current implementation to fix the problem.
