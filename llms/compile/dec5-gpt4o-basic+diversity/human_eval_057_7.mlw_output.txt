=======================TestCases=====================

    For the given implementation, some of testcases failed. Here are the list of failed testcases:
    for input the output we obtained with current implementation is Cons ((Cons 10 (Cons 5 (Cons 15 (Cons 2 (Cons 20 (Nil)))))), true, false); but the expected output is Cons ((Cons 10 (Cons 5 (Cons 15 (Cons 2 (Cons 20 (Nil)))))), true, false)
for input Cons ((Cons 1 (Cons 3 (Cons 2 (Nil)))); the output we obtained with current implementation is true; but the expected output is false)
for input Cons ((Cons 1 (Cons 20 (Cons 4 (Cons 10 (Nil))))); the output we obtained with current implementation is true; but the expected output is false)
 
    Please revise the current implementation to fix the problem.
