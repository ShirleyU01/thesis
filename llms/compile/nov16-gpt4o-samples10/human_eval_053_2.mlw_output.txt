=======================TestCases=====================

    For the given implementation, some of testcases failed. Here are the list of failed testcases:
    for input the output we obtained with current implementation is Cons ((-10), (-20), (-10), (-30)); but the expected output is Cons ((-10), (-20), (-10), (-30))
for input the output we obtained with current implementation is Cons (100, (-50), 100, 50); but the expected output is Cons (100, (-50), 100, 50)
 
    Please revise the current implementation to fix the problem.
