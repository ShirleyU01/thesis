=======================TestCases=====================

    For the given implementation, some of testcases failed. Here are the list of failed testcases:
    for input the output we obtained with current implementation is Cons ((-10), (-10), 0); but the expected output is Cons ((-10), (-10), 0)
 
    Please revise the current implementation to fix the problem.
