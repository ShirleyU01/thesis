=======================TestCases=====================

    For the given implementation, some of testcases failed. Here are the list of failed testcases:
    for input the output we obtained with current implementation is Cons (500, 124750, 125250); but the expected output is Cons (500, 124750, 125250)
for input the output we obtained with current implementation is Cons (200, 19900, 20100); but the expected output is Cons (200, 19900, 20100)
for input Cons (50; the output we obtained with current implementation is 1225; but the expected output is 1275)
for input Cons (1; the output we obtained with current implementation is 0; but the expected output is 1)
for input Cons (10; the output we obtained with current implementation is 45; but the expected output is 55)
for input Cons (5; the output we obtained with current implementation is 10; but the expected output is 15)
for input Cons (100; the output we obtained with current implementation is 4950; but the expected output is 5050)
for input Cons (30; the output we obtained with current implementation is 435; but the expected output is 465)
 
    Please revise the current implementation to fix the problem.
