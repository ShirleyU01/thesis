=======================TestCases=====================

    For the given implementation, some of testcases failed. Here are the list of failed testcases:
    for input the output we obtained with current implementation is Cons ((Cons (-5) (Cons 5 (Cons (-3) (Cons 3 (Nil))))), 5, true, false); but the expected output is Cons ((Cons (-5) (Cons 5 (Cons (-3) (Cons 3 (Nil))))), 5, true, false)
for input Cons ((Cons 10 (Cons 20 (Cons 30 (Nil)))) and 25; the output we obtained with current implementation is true; but the expected output is false)
for input Cons ((Nil) and 10; the output we obtained with current implementation is false; but the expected output is true)
 
    Please revise the current implementation to fix the problem.
