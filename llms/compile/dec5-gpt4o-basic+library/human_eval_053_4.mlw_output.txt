=======================TestCases=====================

    For the given implementation, some of testcases failed. Here are the list of failed testcases:
    for input the output we obtained with current implementation is Cons ((-12345), 67890, 67890, 55545); but the expected output is Cons ((-12345), 67890, 67890, 55545)
for input the output we obtained with current implementation is Cons ((-10), (-20), (-20), (-30)); but the expected output is Cons ((-10), (-20), (-20), (-30))
for input Cons ((-1) and 1; the output we obtained with current implementation is 1; but the expected output is 0)
 
    Please revise the current implementation to fix the problem.
