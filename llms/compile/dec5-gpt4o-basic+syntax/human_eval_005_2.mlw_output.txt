=======================TestCases=====================

    For the given implementation, some of testcases failed. Here are the list of failed testcases:
    for input Cons ((Cons 1 (Cons 2 (Cons 3 (Nil)))) and 5; the output we obtained with current implementation is (Cons 3 (Cons 5 (Cons 2 (Cons 5 (Cons 1 (Nil)))))); but the expected output is (Cons 1 (Cons 5 (Cons 2 (Cons 5 (Cons 3 (Nil)))))))
for input Cons ((Cons 1 (Cons 2 (Nil))) and 5; the output we obtained with current implementation is (Cons 2 (Cons 5 (Cons 1 (Nil)))); but the expected output is (Cons 1 (Cons 5 (Cons 2 (Nil)))))
 
    Please revise the current implementation to fix the problem.
