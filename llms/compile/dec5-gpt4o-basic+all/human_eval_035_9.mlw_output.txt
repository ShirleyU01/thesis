=======================TestCases=====================

    For the given implementation, some of testcases failed. Here are the list of failed testcases:
    for input Cons ((Cons 7 (Cons 7 (Cons 3 (Cons 5 (Cons 7 (Cons 2 (Cons 7 (Cons 1 (Cons 7 (Nil)))))))))); the output we obtained with current implementation is 7; but the expected output is 7)
for input Cons ((Cons 0 (Cons (-10) (Cons 10 (Cons (-10) (Cons 0 (Nil)))))); the output we obtained with current implementation is 10; but the expected output is 10)
 
    Please revise the current implementation to fix the problem.
