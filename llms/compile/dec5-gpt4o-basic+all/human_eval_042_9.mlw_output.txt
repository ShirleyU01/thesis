=======================TestCases=====================

    For the given implementation, some of testcases failed. Here are the list of failed testcases:
    for input Cons ((Cons 5 (Cons 3 (Cons 5 (Cons 2 (Cons 3 (Cons 3 (Cons 9 (Cons 0 (Cons 123 (Nil)))))))))); the output we obtained with current implementation is (Cons 124 (Cons 1 (Cons 10 (Cons 4 (Cons 4 (Cons 3 (Cons 6 (Cons 4 (Cons 6 (Nil)))))))))); but the expected output is (Cons 6 (Cons 4 (Cons 6 (Cons 3 (Cons 4 (Cons 4 (Cons 10 (Cons 1 (Cons 124 (Nil)))))))))))
for input Cons ((Cons (-1) (Cons 0 (Cons 1 (Nil)))); the output we obtained with current implementation is (Cons 2 (Cons 1 (Cons 0 (Nil)))); but the expected output is (Cons 0 (Cons 1 (Cons 2 (Nil)))))
for input Cons ((Cons 1 (Cons 2 (Cons 3 (Nil)))); the output we obtained with current implementation is (Cons 4 (Cons 3 (Cons 2 (Nil)))); but the expected output is (Cons 2 (Cons 3 (Cons 4 (Nil)))))
 
    Please revise the current implementation to fix the problem.
