The postcondition for compare_acc ensures that, when both input lists l1 and l2 are of equal length, the result is a list of the same length, with each element at index i being abs(nth i l1 - nth i l2). A variant is added to compare_acc to ensure termination. The main function compare remains unchanged and is automatically verified with these additions. All specifications are written to be provable by SMT automatically.",
