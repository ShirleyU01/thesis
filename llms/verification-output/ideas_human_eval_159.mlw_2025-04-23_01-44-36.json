The only verification necessary is to ensure that the code satisfies its postcondition for all input values in the allowed range. The ensures clause is already present and matches the desired contract. To strengthen the contract and help the SMT solver, we add preconditions reflecting the input constraints (0 <= number, need, remaining <= 1000). This ensures all possible values are within the domain and assists in proof. No additional lemmas or ghost code are necessary.",
