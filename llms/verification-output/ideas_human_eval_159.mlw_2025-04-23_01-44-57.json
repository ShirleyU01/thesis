            "description": "Add a loop invariant expressing the relationship between n, nd, rem, and the initial values. The invariant maintains that n = number + (need - nd), rem = remaining - (need - nd), and rem >= 0, nd >= 0. This allows SMT solvers to verify the postcondition by relating the final values of n and rem to the initial values and the ensures clause. The loop also requires a variant to prove termination.",
