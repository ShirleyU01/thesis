            "description": "The code for 'multiply' is already correct and non-recursive, so no variants are necessary. The ensures clause is provable, but the only subtlety is that the Why3 standard library's Euclidean modulus operator 'mod' always returns a non-negative result for a positive modulus, so mod (abs a) 10 returns the unit digit of abs a as required. No additional lemmas or ghost code are needed to prove the ensures clause. Thus, the code is already automatically verified by SMT solvers.",
